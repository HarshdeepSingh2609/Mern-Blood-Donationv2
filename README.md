## 🔍 About the Project

This project aims to digitize and manage blood donations through a *role-based access system* and an *inventory-driven approach*.

- Users can register/login as *Donor, **Hospital, **Organization, or **Admin*
- *Donors* can donate blood only after registration
- *Hospitals* can *request* or *donate* blood, but only via a connected *Organization*
- *Organizations* manage the blood inventory, approve requests, and mediate between *donors* and *hospitals*
- *Admins* have full access to all users, organizations, and donation logs
